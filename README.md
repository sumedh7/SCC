# SCC (Skilled Chess Commentator)

Codes of models and data processing for paper "Automated Chess Commentator Powered by Neural Chess Engine, **Hongyu Zang**, **Zhiwei Yu** and **Xiaojun Wan**, **ACL2019**" will be released in this repo.  
([Zhiwei](https://github.com/ArleneYuZhiwei) and me contribute equally in this paper.)


### Note

* We need time to clean up our codes and data, please be patient.

* Before the publication of our paper and codes, you can check previous most related work about Chess Commentary ([GAC](https://github.com/harsh19/ChessCommentaryGeneration)).

* We also use the dataset provided by GAC. You may need to require the permission of distributions of the processed data and scripts from Jhamtani et al. (see previous link).

* We build our chess agent on [alpha-zero-general](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general). If you are interested, you can learn and extend this project.
